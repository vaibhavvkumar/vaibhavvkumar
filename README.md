I’m a Quality Engineer & Automation Enthusiast focused on building reliable, scalable, and high-performance digital experiences.

With a background in full-stack web development and mobile app development, I now specialize in test automation, web application quality assurance, and process optimization.

Before moving deeper into QA, I built static websites for my YouTube channel and worked on front-end and mobile app projects which gives me a strong understanding of how applications are designed, developed, and tested end-to-end.
